# ftr_fibonacci_coding_test

# Fibonacci
Code is split in to 2 parts. 
### core
contains the main logic
### web
contains the ui this uses react

# Getting Started with Fibonacci

This project requires Node to run

## Setup
### `npm ci`
install libs

### `npm run compile`
compile tsc

## To start UI
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## To run unit tests

### `npm test`

Launches the tests

## To build

### `npm run build`
Runs webpack in production mode
Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified .\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


Part 2: Changes to your application
1. You have a new requirement to implement for your application: its logic should stay
exactly the same but it will need to have a different user interface (e.g. if you wrote a
web app, a different UI may be a REPL).
Please describe how you would go about implementing this new UI in your application?
Would you need to restructure your solution in any way?

2. You now need to make your application “production ready”, and deploy it so that it can
be used by customers.
Please describe the steps you’d need to take for this to happen.

3. What did you think about this coding test - is there anything you’d suggest in order to
improve it?
